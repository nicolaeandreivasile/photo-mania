	Implementation of a distributed algorithm that applies filters to a PGM/PNM 
image using MPI. 
	The application reads the header of the image and then the bitmap block, that
is aterwards framed with 0s. 
	For each filter the bitmap block of the image is separated into smaller 
pieces, the number of pieces being equal to the number of processes, and sent to its
corresponding process. Each process, after recieving the bimap piece, applies the 
current filter and sends the computed piece to the main procces where the image is 
being put togheter.
	It creates a new image if it is not existent, and writes the same header of 
the input image and the unframed computed bitmap block, resulting the image with the
filters applied.

	FILTERS: smooth, blur, sharpen, mean, emboss;
		
	> Smoothing filter: ameliorates the differences in images.
	> Approximative Gaussian Blur filter: reduces the background noise in images.
	> Sharpen filter: accentuates the image details.
	> Mean filter: same as sharpen, diagonal pixels are used also. 
	> Emboss: used for detecting edges.
	
	COMPILE: make build
	USAGE: mpirun -n no_processes ./tema3 image_in image_out filter1 
		filter2 ... filterN
	CLEANING: make clean
